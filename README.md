#### This project is completely developed in the cloud environment by using Qwiklabs for using the listed functionalities :

 - **Maps Javascript API**
 - **BigQuery Client API**
 - **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**
						
    Here I had used [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) to visualize taxi drop off locations in 2016 from journeys that started from the block around the Empire State building. This data is stored in a Google BigQuery public dataset.
